# Open-Charity-Theme
Open Charity Theme for Drupal 7


Drupal theme can be managed many ways but, I have created nodes,blocks and region templates for each section to manage it properly. The approach to follow the structure was to make it easy for to understand for other developers and designers to work in this.

- For CSS I have used BEM methodology. 
- Prepos is used for SASS compilation of the project css files. 
- Theme is tested on latest browsers like, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and with IE11.
- For Slider I have used OwlSlider.
- WowJs is used for animation purpose.

External Modules used in Drupal Theme
- Views content panes
- Chaos Tools
